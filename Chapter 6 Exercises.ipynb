    "For this question I followed the textbook again 6.1. I first created a funtion (main) to create/hold the program. Next I had to open the file I created in question 1 of the algorithm workbench, file name my_name.txt. After had create a variable to read and remember the contents of that file. Once that was done I wrote code to close the file so the contents doesnt get edited or deleted. The question wants me to have the program to display the name so I wrote a print statement to print the variable that read and was holding the contents of the file. When all of that was completed I then only had to call upon the main funtion to run everything.  "
