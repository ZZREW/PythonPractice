Once that was done I wrote code to close the file so the contents doesnt get edited or deleted.

    "For this problem I incorporated question 1 and 2 from the algorithm workbench section, while adding new code to print the number list in the problem. I first start by creating a function to hold the main program and to store the file. Next I create a new file named numbers.txt accoring to the question, I made it with the 'w' so I can edit/create the file. For the next part I use code from the previous chapters to create a list of integers that the question wants us to display in this new file. I set an integer equal to 0, and wrote a for statment. For integer in range(1,101) print integer. This code will display a list of numbers from 1 - 100. Next I had to convert the code into a str since im writing numbers into a file. I went back to section 6.1 in our textbook to learn how to write and read numeric data. I didnt know if numbers.write(str(integer)) would work but I input it and it worked so I ran with it. Everything else is basically the same from question 2 of the algorithm workbench, inreguards to creating a new function to read and display the contents of file.\n",
