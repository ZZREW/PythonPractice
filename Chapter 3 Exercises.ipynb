But I kept rereading the question and broke it down, I think its asking me to show if amount 1 is greater then amount 2 then print amount 1, but if amount 2 is greater than amount 1 then print amount 2. So which ever amount is bigger then print that amount. Im not sure if I explained that correctly but the code that I copied paste (if amount1 > 10 and amount2 < 100:) from the question and covert to python language, looks to be writen in the way to display the greater amount in the first place.

    "I used the walk through video to get this question started. I start by making the program ask the user a prompt to enter a year. The year here is my variable. It is equal to the user's input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next I struggle with the word divisible. Not remembering it meant to have a 2 numbers divided by one another and the outcome is 0. The walkthrough video explained this to me. At first my formula setup was year / 100 == 0. This was not working for me so I went back to chapter 2, section 2.7 to make sure I was using the corrct sign for division. Reading table 2-3, I learned that I was using the wrong sign. I then change the formula to year // 100 == 0, which still wasnt working. I went back to the walkthrough video and professor hinted at if and only theres a remainder of 0. Table 2-3 shows that using % gets the remainder. So then I changed the formula to year % 100 == 0 which worked. \n",
